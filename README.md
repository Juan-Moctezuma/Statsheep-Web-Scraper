# Statsheep Web Scraper

### Introduction

The purpose of this Python web scraper is to extract data from Statsheep.com, and generate a 
csv file containing a list of the top 1000 most-viewed Youtube channels. In addition, 
this script generates a bar chart with the top 5 Youtube channels out of those 
1000 channels / YouTubers. The csv document and bar chart update whenever Statsheep does.
